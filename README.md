# MalwareDetectionUsingMachineLearning

In this particular section we are trying to detect and classify malware into 9 different category usin machine learning. Various models such as K-NN , Logistic Regression , Random Forest and XGBoost have been used.
In this section of this project i have used unigram features .
Please stay tuned and in couple of weeks i will upload the next secion of this part in which i will use bigram features and will try to reduce log-loss to 0.01 . 
In part 2 of this project i will use asm files to train and test our machine learning models . 
In the last and final part we will merge these models.
